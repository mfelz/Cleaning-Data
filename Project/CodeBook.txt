Variables:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 81-feature vector with the means and standard deviations of time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Data: 

'total.target': 10299 obvs 81 variables
'summary': 180 obvs of 81 variables - the means of the 81 variables for each combination of subject and activity

transforamtions:

The following transformations were performed to get the 'total.target' data frame

- the training feature data r was appeneded to the test feature data
- the list of training subject lables was appended to the list of test subject labels
- the list of training activity labels was appended to the list of test activity labels
- the the columns of the training activity labels, subject lables, and feature data was column binded
- the variables were then named according to features.txt
- the columns with mean or std in their names were subsetted
- the activity label numbers were replaced with the activity names
- the feature names were cleaned up to get rid of parentheses, replace "-" with ".", "f" with "freq", and "t" with "time"

The summary set was created by aggregating total.target on subject label and activity label using a mean as the formula
